The Bebek Coin Website is designed in WordPress, with all the information necessary for the token and with many challenges I managed to do the integration with the internet identity. Here is a description of my work. I hope it makes sense.


Prerequisites
Before you start, verify that you have:


Downloaded and installed dfx version 0.14.1 or later.
Node.js v16+.


To Get Started:


Start your local replica by running, after that deploying it with your local replica.


/dfx --start --background


/dfx deploy


DFX.Json
Description: We use the dfx.json file as the core configuration for our Internet Computer (IC) project. It contains essential settings required by the DFINITY SDK (dfx) to manage our project. This includes specifying canisters, which are the computational units on the IC, defining build configurations, specifying dependencies, and setting network parameters. Canisters defined in this file are connected and deployed to the ICP mainnet, enabling them to perform decentralized computations and store data. The dfx.json file ensures that all components of our project are correctly configured and can be seamlessly deployed and managed on the Internet Computer.


Index.html
Description: We use the index.html file as the primary webpage for our project, forming the user interface that visitors interact with. This file utilizes HTML to structure and present the frontend elements, including text, images, links, and interactive forms. It defines the layout and visual structure of the website, incorporating various HTML tags and elements to create a cohesive and user-friendly experience. The index.html file is often accompanied by CSS for styling and JavaScript for additional functionality, ensuring a dynamic and responsive web interface.


Index.js
Description: We use the index.js file as a crucial JavaScript file that integrates Internet Identity into our project on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP). This script handles the authentication process, enabling users to securely log in and interact with our application. It leverages the ICP's identity framework to authenticate users, manage sessions, and ensure secure access to the canisters. These canisters, connected and deployed to the ICP mainnet, perform essential backend tasks, such as data processing and storage. The index.js file facilitates seamless interaction between the frontend interface and backend canisters, providing a smooth and secure user experience. It includes functions for handling login, logout, and identity verification, ensuring robust security for our application.

About Bebek Coin README

Dear Judges,
We are excited to present BEBEK Coin, our innovative memecoin launched on the ICP blockchain.

I would like to preface this by saying that I am not a developer, I am community builder, and I have gone to great lengths to hire a developer that understands some of the ICP ecosystem in order to create this code, follow the tasks and create this github. I hope I did a good job, because what I care about is if the website is functioning and the token is live and transferable. Everything else is out of my reach and I did my best.

Our team has worked diligently to complete all the necessary tasks and requirements to bring this project to life. Despite the challenges, we have successfully developed functional smart contracts, deployed the token on the ICP Mainnet, and designed a well-thought-out tokenomics structure. Additionally, we have implemented an innovative airdrop mechanism to ensure fair initial distribution and have cultivated an engaged and enthusiastic community around BEBEK Coin.

Our project is more than just a token; it’s a vibrant and growing community, driven by the fun and engaging spirit of the Duck Army. We are proud of the progress we have made and are excited to continue building and expanding our community. Below, we outline the achievements and goals we have accomplished in detail.
